# Build-sass-project.bat

This repository contains two batch scripts to help you set up and manage a SASS project easily. These scripts automate the process of creating project directories, initializing npm, installing necessary dependencies, and configuring scripts in the `package.json` file.

## Script 1: `Build.bat`

This script sets up the basic structure for a SASS project. It creates the necessary directories, initializes an HTML file (`index.html`), and sets up SASS files (`style.scss` and partials). Additionally, it configures npm scripts for running and watching SASS.

## Script 2: Build-Choice.bat
This script extends the functionality by giving you the option to choose between installing only SASS or both SASS and Bootstrap. It includes a simple menu using `Choice` command.
